Navigation Between Tasks:**\n\n**Dependency Navigation:**\n- `handleDependencyClick` function (line 123) enables seamless navigation between related tasks\n- Click handlers on dependency links load other task details via `onNavigateToTask(depId)`\n- Maintains task context during navigation with proper state updates\n\n**Breadcrumb Navigation:**\n- Hierarchical breadcrumb navigation with support for task → subtask relationships\n- Clickable breadcrumb links for navigating to parent tasks: `onClick={() => onNavigateToTask(parentTask.id)}`\n- Back navigation to Kanban board via `onNavigateBack` callback\n\n**Navigation State Management:**\n- Centralized navigation state in `AppState` with `currentView` ('kanban' | 'task-details') and `selectedTaskId`\n- Redux-style actions: `NAVIGATE_TO_TASK` and `NAVIGATE_TO_KANBAN` in appReducer (lines 437-440)\n- Conditional rendering in TaskMasterKanban component (lines 927-935) based on navigation state\n\n**2. Advanced State Management:**\n\n**React Hooks Implementation:**\n- `useState` for local component state: `currentTask`, `isSubtask`, `parentTask`, `editedDescription`, `isSaving`\n- `useEffect` for task data synchronization and side effects (lines 52-79)\n- `useContext` for accessing VSCodeContext with centralized state management\n\n**Global State Architecture:**\n- Comprehensive `AppState` interface with 12 state properties including tasks, loading, error, polling, navigation, and toast notifications\n- Robust `appReducer` with 15 action types for complete state management\n- Optimistic updates with error handling and rollback capabilities\n\n**Real-time State Synchronization:**\n- Live polling mechanism for task updates from external sources\n- User interaction detection to pause updates during drag operations\n- Network status monitoring with automatic reconnection attempts\n\n**3. Responsive Design Excellence:**\n\n**Mobile-First Approach:**\n- Primary layout: `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3` (line 164) - stacks vertically on mobile, three-column grid on desktop\n- Left column: `md:col-span-2` (line 166) - takes 2/3 width on desktop\n- Right column: `md:col-span-1` (line 246) - takes 1/3 width on desktop\n- Mobile breakpoint: `md:` (768px+) for responsive behavior\n\n**Component-Level Responsive Design:**\n- Breadcrumb: `break-words sm:gap-2.5` for text wrapping and spacing adjustments\n- Button sizing: `sm: \"h-8 rounded-md gap-1.5 px-3\"` and `lg: \"h-10 rounded-md px-6\"` variants\n- Textarea: `md:text-sm` for responsive text sizing\n- Dynamic height calculation with `updateAvailableHeight` function for VS Code panel integration\n\n**Container and Layout Optimization:**\n- Overflow handling: `overflow-auto` for scrollable content areas\n- Spacing: `gap-6 p-6` for consistent spacing across screen sizes\n- Flexible height: `h-full flex flex-col` for proper container sizing\n\n**4. Accessibility Implementation:**\n\n**Semantic HTML Structure:**\n- Proper heading hierarchy with `h1` for task titles and `h4` for section headings\n- Navigation landmarks with `<nav aria-label=\"breadcrumb\">` (breadcrumb.tsx line 7)\n- Form elements with proper `<label>` associations via `htmlFor` attributes\n\n**Keyboard Navigation:**\n- Focus management with `focus-visible:ring-ring/50` and `focus-visible:ring-[3px]` classes\n- Tab navigation support for all interactive elements\n- Button accessibility with proper `role` and `aria-disabled` attributes\n\n**ARIA Implementation:**\n- Breadcrumb: `aria-current=\"page\"`, `aria-disabled=\"true\"`, `role=\"link\"` attributes\n- Separators: `role=\"presentation\"`, `aria-hidden=\"true\"` for screen reader optimization\n- Form validation: `aria-invalid:ring-destructive/20` for error state indication\n\n**Screen Reader Compatibility:**\n- Descriptive text for status indicators and badges\n- Proper contrast ratios with VS Code theme integration\n- Semantic structure with clear content hierarchy\n\n**5. Performance Optimizations:**\n\n**Lazy Loading Implementation:**\n- Task data is loaded on-demand via VSCodeContext\n- Dependency navigation loads tasks efficiently without prefetching\n- Component-level lazy loading through conditional rendering\n\n**Memory Management:**\n- Proper cleanup of event listeners and timers\n- Request timeout handling (10-second timeout) in sendMessage function\n- Efficient state updates with targeted reducers\n\n**Caching and Optimization:**\n- Advanced caching system with LRU eviction in TaskMasterApi\n- Background refresh for frequently accessed data\n- Request deduplication and analytics\n\n**6. Error Handling and User Experience:**\n\n**Graceful Error States:**\n- Task not found handling with user-friendly message and back navigation\n- Loading states with visual indicators (`isSaving` state)\n- Network error handling with toast notifications\n\n**User Feedback:**\n- Visual loading indicators during save operations\n- Toast notification system for success/error messages\n- Connection status indicators with reconnection capabilities\n\n**Technical Implementation Quality:**\n- **TypeScript Integration**: Comprehensive typing with proper interfaces and type safety\n- **VS Code Theme Integration**: Consistent styling with CSS variables (`text-vscode-foreground`, `bg-vscode-input`)\n- **Component Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with reusable components\n- **Performance Monitoring**: Request duration tracking and analytics\n- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup and memory management\n\nThe implementation provides a production-ready, fully accessible, and highly responsive task details interface that seamlessly integrates with the existing Kanban board while maintaining excellent user experience across all device sizes and interaction patterns.\n</info added on 2025-07-02T22:03:17.636Z>",
